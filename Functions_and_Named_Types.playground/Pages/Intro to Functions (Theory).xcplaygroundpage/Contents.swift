/* There are overall 2 types of Types
 called 1) Named Types- They Have Names when they're defined
            ^Structures
            ^Classes
            ^Enumerations
            ^Protocols
        2) Compound Types- They are Unnamed! defined by the types they contain, given by compound signature
            like tuples ("Hello", true), thier compound signature is- (string, Bool
            And Functions are also compound types)
 Types on how the data is stored and how the data is copied
 1-Value types
 var name1="Chris"
 var name2=name1
 name2="sam"
 
 name1==name2 (thi gives false changing value in one has no inference on other )
 Structures and tuples
 2-Reference types
 Classes and Functions
 2 or more instance refer to same data, changing one will change other also hence referenced*/
